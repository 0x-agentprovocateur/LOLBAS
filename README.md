# Living Off The Land Binaries and Scripts

There are three different lists.

* [LOLBins](LOLBins.md)    
* [LOLLibs](LOLLibs.md)    
* [LOLScripts](LOLScripts.md)    


The goal of these lists are to document every binary and script that can be used for other purposes than they are designed to. 
Every binary and script has it's own .md file in the subfolders. That way I should be easier to maintain and reuse. 
I have borrowed examples from the community (And a lot from Red Canary - Atomic Red Team - Thanks @subtee)
Would really love if the community could contribute as much as possible. That would make it better for everyone.
If you think it is hard to make a pull request using github, don't hasitate to send me a tweet and I will add the contribution for you.
