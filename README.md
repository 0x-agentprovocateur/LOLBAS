# Living Off The Land Binaries and Scripts

The goal of these lists are to document every binary and script that can be used for other purposes than they are designed to. 
Every binary and script has it's own .md file in the subfolders. That way I should be easier to maintain and reuse. 

There are two different lists.

* [LOLBins](LOLBins.md)    
* [LOLScripts](LOLScripts.md)
